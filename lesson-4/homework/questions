2. What is the difference between the continue and break statements in Python?
Break and continue loops control the flow of loop in a program.
Continue statements skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
It is used when you want to skip processing for certain cases but continue looping.
Break statement completely exits the loop when encountered.
It is used when you want to stop the loop based on a condition
3. Can you explain the difference between for loop and while loop?
For loop is used when the number of intirations is known.It itirated base on sequence, like list, tuple, string, rage and etc. It automatically stops when the sequence ends.
4. How would you implement a nested for loop system? Provide an example
The outer for loop runs first and controls the number of iterations.
The inner loop runs completely for each iteration of the outer loop.

for i in range(1, 4):  # Outer loop (controls rows)
    for j in range(1, 4):  # Inner loop (controls columns)
        print(f"({i}, {j})", end=" ")  # Print coordinates
    print()  # New line after each row
